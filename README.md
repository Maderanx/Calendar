# C Calendar Project

This C project implements a simple calendar program that allows users to perform various tasks such as finding out the day of the week for a given date, printing all the days of a month, and adding notes for specific dates.

## Features

- **Find Out the Day**: Given a date (DD MM YYYY), the program calculates and displays the day of the week.

- **Print All the Days of a Month**: Users can input a month and year (MM YYYY), and the program prints the calendar for that month, showing all the days along with their corresponding days of the week.

- **Add Note**: Users can add notes for specific dates, with a maximum of 50 characters per note.

## Usage

1. Compile the C program using a C compiler (e.g., gcc).
2. Run the compiled executable.
3. Choose from the available options to perform the desired task:
   - Find out the day of the week for a given date.
   - Print all the days of a specific month.
   - Add a note for a particular date.
   - Exit the program.
